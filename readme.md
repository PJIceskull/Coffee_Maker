## About Project

For this project I will be using firebase to recreate the coffee page from [Keurig](https://www.keurig.com/c/coffeemakers101?cm_sp=bo+cybermonday21-_-promo+hero+banner-_-shop+coffee+makers).
This site will have a working shopping cart, log in and create an account page and show at least 10 coffee machines. Nothing else needs to work on the page, but you must have everything on there. ex. navigation, banner, footer etc.
